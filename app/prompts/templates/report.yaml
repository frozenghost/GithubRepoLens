description: Prompt for generating final structured report
template: |
  Based on your deep research of {{ repo_url }}, generate a beautifully structured and detailed final Markdown report.

  The report should be highly professional, resembling a deep technical white paper. Please ensure it includes the following sections:

  # {{ project_name }} - Technical Perspective Analysis

  ## 0. Executive Summary
  Concisely summarize the essence of the project, its core value, and most significant technical characteristics.

  ## 1. Project DNA & Abstractions
  Thoroughly explain the core problem the project solves and its abstract modeling of the real world.

  ## 2. Deep Architectural Analysis
  - **Logical Architecture**: Use Mermaid syntax to draw a global or local architecture diagram.
  - **Core Logic Flow**: Use Mermaid sequence diagrams or flowcharts to describe critical business paths.
  - **Directory & Module Organization**: Explain the logical organization behind the physical directory structure.

  ## 3. Under the Hood (Core Mechanisms)
  Explain how core features are implemented through deep-dive topics, using clear explanations and code references.

  ## 4. Engineering Excellence (Code Highlights)
  Showcase the most elegant or efficient code implementations, using standard Markdown code blocks with step-by-step technical insights.

  ## 5. Ecosystem & Technical Choices
  Objectively analyze the reasoning behind major third-party library selections and how they integrate with the core system.

  ## 6. Trade-offs & Future Outlook
  Based on the current state of the code, objectively discuss the technical strengths and potential limitations in specific scenarios.

  Ensure the report is detail-rich, visually engaging (utilizing Mermaid diagrams and code blocks), and provides deep resonance for the reader.
