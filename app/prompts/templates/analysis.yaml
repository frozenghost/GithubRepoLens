description: Prompt for detailed repository analysis
template: |
  Perform a deep research on the GitHub repository {{ repo_url }}. Through systematic exploration, generate a professional report covering the following dimensions in {{ language }}:

  ## 1. Project DNA & Core Abstractions
  - **Core Proposition**: Explain in one sentence the essential technical problem this project solves.
  - **Tech Stack Perspective**: Primary languages, core frameworks, and their specific roles in this project.
  - **Core Abstractions**: What are the most critical models, interfaces, or classes? How do they define the system's behavior?

  ## 2. Architectural Blueprint (Deep Deconstruction)
  - **Global View**: What is the organizational logic? Is it layered, micro-kernel, or a highly decoupled plugin-based architecture?
  - **Core Process Visualization**: **MUST** include one or more Mermaid flowcharts or sequence diagrams explaining key data or control flows.
  - **Module Boundaries**: How do core components communicate? What decoupling strategies are used?

  ## 3. Implementation Principles (Under the Hood)
  - **Key Feature Implementation**: Select 2-3 core features and explain their underlying implementation logic in depth.
  - **Design Patterns in Action**: Identify the design patterns that play a critical role and explain the complexity they solve.
  - **Trade-offs**: Analyze key decisions made between performance, scalability, and simplicity.

  ## 4. Code Highlights & Engineering Excellence
  - **Clever Implementations**: Pick the most impressive code snippets.
  - **Performance & Optimization**: How does the project handle resource utilization or response speed?
  - **Engineering Practices**: Showcase excellent programming paradigms or unique error handling and monitoring strategies.
  - **Format Requirement**: Highlights must include specific code blocks with clear, simplified explanations of the principles.

  ## 5. Dependency Landscape Analysis
  - **Key Dependency Selection**: Why were these specific libraries chosen? What irreplaceable role do they play?
  - **Integration Strategy**: How does the project encapsulate or extend third-party libraries?

  ## 6. Objective Technical Outlook
  - Based on the current code structure, analyze potential technical challenges when supporting larger scales or more complex scenarios (stay objective and based on technical facts).

  Use tools to dive deep into file contents. The report should be insightful, logically rigorous, and easy for technical professionals to understand.

  IMPORTANT: The entire report must be in {{ language }}.
